  <h1>San Want Taipei Residences</h1>
<p>22-24 July 2017</p>
<p>We hoped to go to a very high-end hotel for these two nights but they were all booked. Saturday night is practically unavailable so worth booking in advance. But in this case, we got lucky with this hotel.</p>
<p>It is a fairly young hotel opened up in 2008 which is perhaps why they're not resting on their laurels. It is not only young, it is fairly small with maybe half a dozen rooms on our floor, giving it a nice cosy feeling that larger hotels don't offer.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the hotel was its name. The taxi driver who took us there went to another similarly named hotel that is apparently a good 20 minute ride away. It was our fault for not disambiguating but I'm sure the driver also knew what was going on, even after clarifying he took turns and then turned around for extra effect. If you book here, make sure the driver doesn't act a fool. What was supposed to be a NT$80 5-minute ride turned out to be NT$200 20-minute ride.</p>
<p>The ground level's lounge area welcomes you with free snacks, barley tea, coffee and bright sitting area. There is no pretentiousness, it feels all just right.</p>
<p>Our room had a king-size bed. You can sit at the desk on an ergonomic office chair, which is what many more expensive hotels lack.</p>
<p>There is an afternoon tea for a low fee. Breakfast was somewhat underwhelming in terms of desserts but otherwise was good.</p>
<p>You really feel a lot more at home than at a big hotel. Big hotel at this price will not show you to the room or help with your luggage.</p>
<p>The bathroom has a walk-in bathtub made from concrete/granite/whatever, just not plastic. It's square in shape and super comfortable.</p>
<p>Toiletries offered are L'occitane.</p>
<p>It's right next to a park and close to food and massage areas.</p></body>
