<p>Nice place. When you go in, you see the kitchen, and you'll be told to go upstairs for the food.</p>
<p>The menu is varied, with a knack for dumplings. There are dessert choices and teas.</p>
<p>I got myself a side vegetable dish, mushroom &amp; vegetable dumplings and a fruit tea. The fruit tea contains some apple, lemon and citrus. Was fairly sweet.</p>
<p>Food is decent quality and WiFi is no problem to log onto.</p>
<p>They understood my broken Mandarin.</p></body>
