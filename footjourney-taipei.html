  <p>From the outside you'll be greeted with the sight of stone foot baths.</p>
<p>I believe the receptionist is the owner, who has a very friendly and down-to-earth character and smile. She explained everything and even answered questions I already had in mind before I had the chance to speak them.</p>
<p>Our choice was to do full body massage including legs. They do TuiNa (TCM) as part of that.</p>
<p>10 minute foot bath, then 30 minute foot massage and friendly conversation with intelligent professionals, with a fungus dessert and barley tea.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we were taken to massage rooms upstairs next door. It was a good 1 hour of agony and constant adjustment... "

<p>Following the massage we had a nice conversation with the staff. I learned that "măidān" applies more to restaurants than a massage place.</p></body>
